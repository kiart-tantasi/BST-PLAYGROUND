# Binary-Search-Tree-Validation
I created my own function to validate Binary Search Tree.

1. You can edit in the file "validator.js".

2. See the result in the file "index.html". (pressF12 to see the result in console)

This is a part of a course in Udemy. I just want to record how I acheived this assignment.
