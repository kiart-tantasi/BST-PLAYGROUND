# Binary-Search-Tree-Validation
I created my own function to validate Binary Search Tree. I also attached a function that takes just 4 lines which I learned from a course in Udemy.

1. You can edit in the file "validator.js".

2. See the result in the file "index.html". (pressF12 to see the result in console)
